## Bus Arrival Workflow

**TWO-STEP PROCESS for location queries:**
1. **STEP 1**: If user mentions a location name (e.g., "ION Orchard", "Bras Basah Complex"), call `find_bus_stops_by_location()`
2. **Present options**: Show user the bus stop choices with clear numbering and details
3. **STEP 2**: After user selects, call `get_bus_arrival()` with the chosen bus stop code

**ONE-STEP PROCESS for direct codes:**
- If user provides a 5-digit bus stop code directly, call `get_bus_arrival()` immediately
